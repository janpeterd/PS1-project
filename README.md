# Museum visit planner (work in progress)

This is a web-application that helps you plan your visit to a museum. It will make it easier for visitor and organizer to plan the visit.

It is made as a group project for school for a small museum in my area. 

_\*Not intended for general usage, this is our first time working with this framework.\*_

## Idea
1. Visitor fill in form and choose date/time
2. E-mails get send to all guides
3. Guides confirm by pressing butten in E-mail, if no one confirms after 5 days the visitor gets notified
4. Guide gets assigned to visit.

### Technologies used
* Django (framework)
* Python (language)
* Cron (scheduled background tasks)
* HTML/CSS (frontend)
* Bootstrap (frontend)
* Postgres (databse)
  * Supabase (cloud database)
